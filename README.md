This is a work distribution system for [westpa](https://github.com/westpa/westpa) 
(an adaptive molecular dynamics simulation driver). The implementation
is heavily based on [zmq-broker](https://github.com/samueltardieu/zmq-broker)
by Samuel Tardieu <sam@rfc1149.net>. This software is intended for 
a compute cluster that provides global data access to all nodes via NFS.
